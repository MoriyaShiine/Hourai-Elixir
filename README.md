# Hourai Elixir

Based on this: https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Hourai_Elixir

Once consumed, the player can *never* die, and is immune to negative potion effects. Upon "dying," the player loses
their immunity for a while and gets increasingly worse debuffs the more they die sequentially. "Dying" is in quotes
because your player will never actually perish, but you will revive on the spot with the aforementioned debuffs.

Of course, such a powerful item is unobtainable in survival.
